What's wrong with D&D (and how other systems do it better)

**Action economy**. Bonus actions are dumb. Many classes simply don't have them. And other classes *rely* on them. Action economy is hard to balance for encounters. To make a single big monster worth fighting, I've got to arbitrarily give it more actions. Which means players are playing by completely different rules than the DM. And that means I've got to learn two sets of rules: what the players can do, and what the NPCs can do. See also: increased cognitive load.

In narrative systems like PbtA, you don't have a "turn." You do a thing, and the camera is on you for as long as it takes to resolve that thing. 

In Genesys, *everyone* has the same options: actions, maneuvers, incidentals. There's no "my class doesn't have any bonus actions." You can always build your character to have *more* options, but at least every character starts on an even playing field.

**Prep is a lot of time and work**. It takes a long time to build a balanced encounter. And this can lead to railroading, because if I spent two hours designing a cool map and a fun encounter, I'm going to try to funnel the players toward it, subconsciously or otherwise (or else I just wasted a bunch of time designing content that will never get played). 

Designing interesting monsters is a lot of work. Only for them to be defeated after 1-3 rounds of combat anyway. And it doesn't matter how cool I make their abilities; if they roll low, then they never actually see play. 

Designing magic items is a lot of work (and it feels bad when they just end up in the bag of holding, never to be seen again). 

Designing quests you never do, or places you never explore, or abilities you never use, it's all very time consuming. If there's a plot hook, then there at least has to be some form of content to be played. Which means I at least need a map or two, some monsters, some NPC personalities, some interesting loot. This is true of any RPG, but D&D makes each of these steps take more time than they should.

Choosing/designing battlemaps is a lot of work. Everything has to fit nicely with the 5ft grid. It has to be interesting to play and visually appealing, but it also has to fit the narrative too. 

Because there are so many moving parts and complex systems, it's really hard to improvise compelling content on the fly. To run a monster, I've got to study its statblock, learn the hyper specific wording of each of its abilities, pay attention to its several damage/condition resistances. And if it's a caster, I have to look up every single one of its spells and have those handy. Times however many monsters there are in each encounter. Times the number of encounters. It's a ton of work just trying to figure out how to play these monsters in combat, but then I have to run several of them simultaneously. And each ability has *very* specific wording. I forget monster abilities all the time, or mess up the ones I do remember to actually use. And that makes me feel bad about my ability to run games.

In D&D, an enemy stat block is at least 20 numbers (on the conservative side), plus any dice formulas, saves, proficiencies, senses, languages, special abilities, alignment, type, size, etc. And on top of that, there is all the hyper-specific wording of each ability that I have to parse every single time it takes an action.

In short, D&D sort of forces the DM to devote the bulk of their prep time dealing with bloated D&D mechanics, instead of focusing on having fun. I want to have fun too, and **this stuff isn't fun for me**.

In FATE, an enemy stat block is like 6 numbers and a sentence. And session content is largely driven by player choice, rather than anything predesigned by the GM.

In Genesys, adversaries can be created on the fly pretty easily. Pick a characteristic array, give them 4 skills, a weapon, armor, and adjust their dice pool based on how challenging they should be to overcome.

In Dungeon World, you've got 3 numbers, a few Moves (usually just 2-5 words each), and 3 or 4 tags. And a lot of the actual adventure content is generated on the fly *by design*. 

In any of these other systems, I can run monsters very quickly. And since I'm not getting bogged down by the specific mechanics of their abilities, I have a lot more energy to focus on *making a fun and interesting encounter.*(**!!!**)



**Lack of character build options**. Most classes, once you pick a subclass, that's it. Your progression is on rails, except for ASI (or feats, which RAW are optional, and some DMs do not allow). The only real variety you get with builds is through multiclassing (which again is optional; some DMs do not allow). And even then, it's the same problem; pick a subclass and you're done. So your main points of customization are: ASI, feats, spell selection, and multiclassing.

And multiclassing has its own pitfalls. For one, it's arbitrary. "Oh BTW I'm a wizard now. I wasn't yesterday, but today it's as though I've been studying my whole life for it." You've never touched a sword in your life, but one night you decide to take a level in fighter, and now you're proficient not just with swords but with practically ALL weapons.

Another multiclassing pitfall is more player-specific, but it opens up the door to cheesy builds. Most power-builds involve dipping Warlock at some point. 

In FATE, your imagination (and what the table agrees on) is the only limit. You pick a high concept and a few aspects, stunts, and flaws. 

In Dungeon World, you choose new abilities from a list at every level. 

In Genesys, you spend XP at any time (since there are no levels) to gain talents or improve skills. And your career is not restrictive like a class is; a Soldier doesn't necessarily have to play like a martial class.



**(Some) Progression is meaningless**. Yes, your fighter does twice as much damage now because of extra attacks, but enemies all have twice as many hit points. So nothing actually changed. Now your turns take twice as long, because you've got twice as many rolls to make, but the end result is the same. Each turn, you drain X% of the enemy's hit points, and that X remains pretty constant whether you're 3rd level or 13th level. Also, your to-hit bonus and spell save DC goes up, but so do the enemy saves and AC. No matter how big your numbers get, you're always going to have an X% chance to hit. And again, that X is pretty constant from 1st level through 20th. You are going to succeed roughly 60% of the time.  Your max HP goes up, but so does all the damage you are taking. Etc. So the bigger numbers are mostly *just an illusion*.

Many other systems don't have HP bloat. You've pretty much got the same health at the beginning as you do later in the campaign. It's just that you've gotten better (hopefully) at avoiding damage, choosing your battles, improving your tactics, etc.

In Genesys, if you build to do more damage, it's a lot more meaningful because enemy HP doesn't scale with your damage. Your heavy hitter could take down a powerful adversary even if you are low-XP; the enemy doesn't arbitrarily have like 600 hit points because of CR or whatever.

**Pure martials are boring**. Their progression is basically "make more attacks," which makes simply increases damage output and increases the length of their turns without actually giving them meaningful choices. 

I honestly think all martials should have Battlemaster maneuvers. That's basically how 4E was. And that was fun. When I played a martial class in 4e, aside from Opportunity Attacks, I don't think I ever just made a "Basic Melee Attack." There was no point; I had tons of other cool things I could do, every single turn.

In a narrative system like Dungeon World, you have a bit more freedom, and your moves and attacks will have different results according to how you describe them. Want to try to hold the enemy at a distance with your spear? Cool, roll Defend. Want to make a big, reckless cleaving attack with your greataxe and try to get all 3 goblins with one strike? You'll leave yourself wide open, but hell yeah, roll Hack & Slash. Want to try to parry and riposte? Hack & Slash. Want to wrestle the guard down to the floor and try to splash a vial of acid through the visor of his helmet? Sweet, roll Hack & Slash. It's a versatile move, and the outcome depends on what you are trying to accomplish.

In Genesys, you can spend your advantages and triumphs to accomplish things beyond damage. Knock their weapon out of their hand, take them down to the ground, daze them, anger them and draw aggro, break their spear in half, or hit them with a crit and just bash their skull in, and demoralize their allies in the process.



**Initiative is boring**. Everything is predictable (though this might be seen as a good thing by some). Initiative bonuses only matter on the first round of combat. You can't delay your turn; you only have the nerfed "ready an action" option for that. 

Our house-ruled version does make it more interesting, but also presents its own problems with effect durations and the swinginess. 

There are many ways to do this differently: slot-based a la Genesys, narrative-based a la PbtA (as in, there is no initiative), Popcorn (i.e. you pick who goes next). These other systems allow for more player communication and combo-making, and keep people engaged even when it's not their turn. It gives you the power to say "I have a plan, can I go next?" or to plan out some elaborate strategy.

**Spells are too restrictive**. Due to how they have to be *very* specifically worded, most spells have a single purpose. If there's no existing spell for what you're trying to do, then you just can't do it.

Genesys is pretty cool about this. You *can* do pre-designed spells like D&D if you want, but you aren't *forced* to. And you can always tweak a spell on the fly. The whole system is focused on *intent*. What are you trying to accomplish with this spell? Okay, here's what to roll for that.

Remember Smudge trying to use Create Water to drown someone? That's the kind of thing I so dearly want to say "YES!!!" to. But allowing that to happen "breaks" D&D because "that's too powerful for a level one spell" or "that's a utility spell" or "a mouth isn't an open container" (even though it *totally* freaking is). And furthermore, so what if the cultist is drowning? She can go 4 minutes (40 rounds!) without breathing and be fine.

If that had been Genesys,  I might say "Okay that sounds like a difficulty 4, and they'll be staggered for the duration (can't take actions). That work for you? Alright, let's see what you've got! And then maybe she could spend any advantage or a story point to also have them flail wildly in a gurgling panic, giving setback to the other nearby cultists, or fall prone, etc).

**Pedantic rules**. Too many moving parts means making sure everything is worded *just right*. No wiggle room. And this leads to rules-lawyering at the table. And this can lead to stopping play while we look up Sage Advice to see if Jeremy Crawford or Mike Mearls would allow something in *their* game. And for every single ruling, there's the possibility the next day because an item and an object are two different things, or "melee weapon attack // attack with a melee weapon" are two different things.

For instance, you cannot throw a rat; you can only throw a weapon with the "thrown" property or an object (which must be inanimate), which counts as an "improvised weapon." However, an *enemy* could throw a rat at you just because I gave it the "Throw Rat" ability. 

In a rules-light system (and to a lesser extent in a "rules-medium" narrative system like Dungeon World), you just ask, "Does this situation make sense?" And then you get back to the action. *Of course* you could throw a rat. You just pick it up and throw it. How far can you throw it? As far as it makes sense. We don't need rules for that. What's much more important is *why* you are throwing the rat in the first place.

There's also none of this "hang on, let's use Pythagorean theorem to determine if you have enough move speed to hit them," which falls apart even further when you consider that D&D movement/distance generally has to happen in 5ft increments. Sorry, you can't throw a dart that far; he's 60.5 feet away and your range is only 60.

**Binary pass/fail**. It involves a lot of plain "yes" or "no." "Okay that hits, go ahead and roll damage." "No, you fail to pick the lock." "Yes, you find enough food to make dinner."

Genesys narrative dice allow the possibility for something interesting on every roll. In PbtA, "partial success" is more likely than anything else, at least at earlier levels. In FATE, you can either fail, tie (succeed at a cost), succeed with no cost, or succeed with style (succeed with additional benefit). The game mechanics encourage more dynamic storytelling based on the dice.

"Yes, you manage to track down a deer, but it was absolute hell actually finishing it off. After an hour, you've secured dinner (2d4 rations) for the evening, but you took a tumble into a ravine in the process. When you hit the bottom, you heard a loud crunching sound... some item in your backpack broke. What was it?"

Yeah, that's easy enough to house-rule into D&D. But it's still a hack, whereas other systems have that kind of thing built in. (In Dungeon World, that would have been a Partial Success on your Forage roll, with me making the "Use Up Their Resources" move as a consequence).

**Hit point grind**. Hit points are dumb. And most combat actions that don't deal damage just aren't worth doing. The goal isn't to find a solution to a problem; the goal is to grind the enemies' hit points down to zero.

In more narrative systems, you can defeat a foe without ever doing a single hit point of damage. That's a lot more difficult in D&D. 

In D&D, you defeat a water elemental by reducing its HP to zero. In Genesys, you might defeat it by covering it with so much dirt that it loses its form and turns to mud. Or By trapping it inside a container.

**Combat takes forever**. A single combat generally isn't less than half an hour, and can sometimes take 2-3 hours (or more). And as you get to higher levels, each peoples' turns take longer and longer. So when it's not your turn, you might be sitting there for 20+ minutes, with absolutely nothing to do. As a result, you spend a whole lot of time *not actually playing D&D*. And then after waiting all that time, you go to cast a spell, only for the enemy to make their save. So you accomplished nothing at all, and now have to wait another 20+ minutes to try anything else. And you can just check your phone or do a Sudoku or whatever, because you know there are exactly 9 more turns before your next one. (though this might be seen as a benefit by some)

In a narrative system, your "turn" takes as long as it takes to describe what's happening and resolve the complications. And your next "turn" happens whenever it makes sense in the context of the scene. It's more like a TV show

Genesys is a mixed bag. The modifiers can drag things out. But certain things are streamlined. Take a "fireball" type spell, for instance. There's no "okay let me roll damage and 9 saving throws." Instead, it's just "I spend 2 advantage to trigger Blast. Everyone in range  takes 6 wounds. You are seared!!"

**Combat is repetitive**. On top of the Hit Point Grind and Combat Takes Forever, there just isn't a whole lot going on. Monsters don't have weak points; you can just poke the frost giant's toe until he dies. There's no variety in attacks; you just swing your weapon. It doesn't matter *how* you attack or *where* you hit the enemy; the result is the same. You can't call shots, so there's no distinction between hitting their head or hitting their arm. Either way, all that happens is they lose HP. So many turns can be reduced to "Move, attack, attack."

And some conditions just straight up suck. Your character gets stunned? Okay, now you have to wait 30 minutes to play D&D again, instead of just 15. It's basically just a "time out" for the player. Go do an extra sudoku or something.

(Perhaps this is just a failure on my part in terms of encounter design, rather than a D&D problem.)

In Dungeon World, there's no "I attack." Okay, how? "With my spear." Okay, but *how*?! What you do largely determines what your enemy can or can't do. And there's freedom to put in the "attack its weak point" trope. You can't just stand next to it and roll to hit with your sword; you've got to find a good spot on its soft underbelly first, while it tries to step on you. 

In Genesys, the dice can make some weird stuff happen. Okay, your blaster bolt missed and went astray, hitting the controls for the fire suppression system. Now everyone is covered in foam that is rapidly hardening. What do you do? Or you can take two setback dice to try to shoot the enemy's gun out of her hand. Or spend a triumph to roll a crit, having the guard take the arrow to the knee. Now he can't use that leg for the rest of the combat (and can't be an adventurer like you anymore).

**Binary health**. You're either functioning at full capacity or you're unconscious and bleeding out. There's no in-between. A character at 1% health is just as effective as a character at 100% health.

It also doesn't matter how close you came to death. Bleeding out and 2 failed death saves? After a single healing word, you're back up like nothing ever happened.

In Genesys, wounds don't kill you. Critical Injuries kill you. Get enough wounds to go down, and you get a Critical Injury (which, depending on the d100 roll, might be a one-time penalty or an ongoing debuff). The more critical injuries you have, the higher your future critical injury rolls are (+10 for each). Stack too many critical injuries, and death is all but guaranteed. (140 or higher on critical injury roll is the only non-narrative way for a character to die).

**Healing**. Unless you go Life Cleric, your healing simply can't keep up with the amount of damage being thrown out. Heals are basically relegated to get unconscious characters back on their feet, potentially leading to "whack-a-mole" combat.

Healing tends to be much more important in any system that doesn't have D&D's HP bloat. You don't need 4-5 different tiers of healing potions if your max HP has barely gone up since the beginning of the campaign.

In Genesys, healing is extremely important because critical injuries require some sort of treatment to make them go away. But *anyone* can at least attempt to heal someone with a Medicine check. You can even try to heal yourself, though it's much more difficult.

**Resting**. Six hours of sleep gets you back to 100%.

In Genesys, resting heals your strain, but only some of your wounds. You still need to seek medical treatment (or rest for several days) if you want to get back up to full health. 

In Dungeon World, resting heals half your HP and costs a ration. You have to rest for 3 days in a row to remove any "debilities" (stat debuffs).

**CR and the adventuring day**. Due to the arbitrary "balance" imposed by other mechanics, the game assumes a certain level of resource attrition. This shifts the focus from "encounters that further the narrative" to "encounters that drain resources." If you don't have the latter sprinkled into every adventuring day, then the former can become trivialized. The encounter balancing system does not account for having a party with resources at full tank. This makes designing "balanced" encounters a pain in the ass, and forces DMs to throw resource-draining things at parties almost arbitrarily, just because that is the playstyle the game tries to impose. By default, the rules assume six medium-difficulty encounters between long rests, with one short rest somewhere in between. If you don't adhere to that specific play style, the CR system starts to fall apart, and adventure design gets trickier.

Genesys has a similar philosophy, but the resource management is much different. You don't have spell slots, and "once per day" powers are pretty uncommon (and must be chosen by you when building your character). 

In something like FATE (or to a lesser extent, Dungeon World), there is no such system in place. The focus is on creating an interesting story, rather than letting game mechanics dictate the pacing of the adventure. j

There's none of that metagame "That dragon would be CR 16, there's no way it's real; we're only level 5."

**"Skyrim" inventory.** The weakest possible starting character can still haul 20 shovels and 10 baskets around and not suffer any sort of encumbrance. And they still have both hands free to fight. Between the party members and the bag of holding, you can currently carry up to 1160 pounds of stuff with you at all times. 

The fact that you're wearing heavy armor, carrying five weapons, and wearing two backpacks full of stuff has *absolutely no effect* on your ability to run, climb, jump, or fight. In addition, even if you have a backpack full of potions in glass bottles, you can get smacked around with a hammer and fall off a cliff, but none of those glass bottles will ever break. Anything on your person is practically intangible and absolutely indestructible (barring a Rust Monster or similar encounter), until you put it down. And you can smack a boulder with your wooden staff a billion times, and the staff will never get damaged.

Other systems use a more slot-based approach, or simply have lower carry weights, which makes inventory management a lot more meaningful. Do you bring enough food for the return trip, even if that means you might run out of ammo before the quest is over? Or do you just hope you're able to forage along the way? D&D's variant encumbrance works well enough for this, too.

And in Dungeon World or Genesys, your equipment can be damaged or broken as part of the rolls. So now you've actually got to manage your equipped inventory as a resource. 

**Very little distinction between weapons**. A battleaxe and a longsword are the same. A flail is just a slightly worse warhammer. A glaive and a halberd are completely identical, even down to the weight and the cost. A morningstar is just a heavier and more expensive war pick, and both are just a slightly worse rapier. A mace is just a slightly worse quarterstaff. A club is just a slightly worse light hammer. There are very few opportunities for meaningful choices (like the 1d12 greataxe vs 2d6 greatsword debate). 

Genesys handles this really well, by giving weapons different stats and qualities. Rather than just damage, weapons also have crit ratings (basically, how easy it is to crit with it), hard points (how many modifications/alterations it can hold), and qualities. For instance, while the damage is the same, a sword lets you fight more defensively, but axes have deadlier critical hits. It's harder to crit with a war hammer, but it can stun or knock down the opponent (or both) in addition to its damage. 

Dungeon World has a more abstract system of "tags" for various weapons, and damage is based on the character using it rather than the weapon itself. A fighter always does 1d10 base damage, whether it's with a knife or a greatsword. But the knife might be more precise, while the greatsword is more menacing and messy.

**Weapon/damage restriction**. You can't slice with a dagger or longsword, you can only pierce. You can't bludgeon with the haft of your halberd, or stab with your longsword. You can't choke someone with the chain of your flail.

In Genesys and Dungeon World, a weapon just does damage. It's up to you to decide what that means based on how you attack with it. In Dungeon World, you might not even need to roll for the attack or damage. For instance, if you manage to successfully sneak up behind someone and slit their throat, don't bother rolling to attack. You just auto hit and kill them immediately. The more interesting part is what happens next.

Spell damage in Genesys is more about the narrative of the spell, rather than damage type. There aren't different damage types in Genesys, but there's still room for "Pokemon Logic" or something similar, or for more narrative freedom of resolutions outside of damage.

**Hard to design balanced homebrew**. Without extensive playtesting, it's very easy to make something that is very over- or under-powered.

This is going to be true with any system to an extent, though it's much less of a problem in narrative systems without all the moving parts. In Dungeon World, a monster is more of a set of ideas, rather than a bunch of stats and abilities. 

**Oversimplification through advantage/disadvantage**. It's nice in theory, but leads to some awkward situations. Two blind people fighting is identical to two sighted people fighting. Unconscious/incapacitated foes still get an AC bonus from dexterity. You can shoot at extremely long range just fine as long as you have a buddy next to you taking the Help action (whatever that even means).

Genesys has boost and setback dice (and ways to mitigate/enhance them through character build choices), as well as difficulty and ability upgrades/downgrades. It can lead to unwieldy dice pools however (alright, roll 3 yellow, 1 green, 2 purple, 1 red, 3 blue, 2 black, but remove 1 black because of your Knack For It talent). Dungeon World actually leans into the simplification of the roll even harder, but the flow of the game makes it work out differently. If you bum rush a surprised enemy, you might not even have to roll Hack & Slash; you just go ahead and roll your damage. But on the other hand, if it's a dangerous situation, you might have to make a Defy Danger roll to even get close enough to attempt to Hack & Slash. So that's two opportunities for complications. It all depends on the context. 

In 3.5e D&D, there are stacks of various circumstantial bonuses and penalties on rolls. You might get a +2 from this, another +2 from that, a -1 from the other thing, +1d8 from the bard, +1d4 from the cleric, -1d4 from the enemy aura, +2 for flanking, -5 for power attack, +1 from a feat you took, +2 from your magic weapon, +2 for catching the enemy flat-footed, -5 for defensive fighting, +1 for it being your favored enemy, +1 because you prayed at a certain shrine earlier, +14 for your base attack bonus. Alright, go ahead and roll 1d20+1d8+1d4-1d4+16. Four times, because you're a martial. You need a 32 to hit.

**Hard to teach to new players**. Brand identity is pretty much the only reason D&D is most peoples' first TTRPG experience. There's very little about it that is beginner-friendly. Hell, you can play for years and still get a bunch of rules wrong, or not know the full extent of what your character can do.

Take something like Quick Quest; all the rules fit on a single page. The GM describes a situation, and the player says what they do. Make a roll. Okay, all good, or are there complications? That's pretty much the whole game, the TTRPG experience distilled into a single page of mechanics. See also: Honey Heist, or Risus (though that's a whopping 4 pages). A Risus "character sheet" fits on a post-it.

**Cognitive load at the table**. I've been playing for a good while, and still almost every single session, I have to look up some rules reference (or some Sage Advice about that rule because the rules were too unclear). More attention and energy toward rules-minutiae means less attention and energy available for roleplay and narrative.

Genesys arguably has *more* cognitive load, but it is shifted toward narrative instead of game mechanics. You're always interpreting dice results. You're always coming up with ways to spend threat and advantage. But it's still a relatively crunchy game, for better or for worse.

 In FATE, if it makes sense for the story, then it just works. We don't need no convoluted mounted combat rules. Dungeon World is somewhere in the middle. But the specifics for each roll are listed under each move. 

Let's say you're in a room with three angry orcs, and you want to escape by casting invisibility. So you cast the spell, and roll a success. Yeah, they saw you do it, but that success means that not only are you invisible, but you have successfully used the invisibility to escape from the immediate threat. There are no stealth rolls or opposed perception checks. If you had rolled a partial success on your Cast a Spell check, I might "Put You In A Spot" as a consequence, and now you've got to figure out a way to give these orcs the slip. They still can't see you, but because you didn't Succeed, you aren't out of danger yet. And there's nothing about "how does invisibility work" in the rulebook; we decide what invisible means based on what's happening in the scene.



**IN SHORT:**

I think Genesys is a nice balance between narrative play and mechanical crunch. The rules enhance the narrative, rather than restricting your options. Everything is more cinematic.

I think Dungeon World lets you engage with all the typical D&D-fantasy tropes without being held back by a character sheet. But it has enough structure in place where everybody is always playing by the rules at all times.

I think FATE is a different beast for a different style of game entirely.
